# pathfinding

pathfinding is a Python application for visualising the shortest path between two points.
You can choose start and end points, draw obstacles, and generate a maze. Since Depth-first Search does not guarantee to find the shortest path, it should be used only in a maze. 

## Implemented algorithms

* Breadth-first Search
* Dijkstra's Algorithm
* A* Search
* Depth-first Search

## Requirements

* pygame
* tkinter

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
